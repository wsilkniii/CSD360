        Once upon a time I was very sick. I missed nearly four months of school, all because of <span id ="thyroid"> _____________
      </span> issues. Doctors had no clue what was going on at the time, so I just dealt with it. I passed out at school and work multiple times, yet I was consistently told I had <span id="blood-sugar">_____________</span>.
      We finally found a doctor who found out what was wrong with me. I had <span id="graves"> ____________</span> and an ulcer.
