           The flow of time is always cruel… Its speed seems <span id = "different"> _________
        </span> for each person, but no one can change it… A thing that doesn’t change with time is a memory of younger days

            It’s dangerous to go <span id = "alone"> _____</span>, take this! 
        </p>
        <p>
